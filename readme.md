# Gemini Audio Text-to-Speech CLI

**Last Updated:** October 22, 2024

This Python script provides a command-line interface to interact with the Google Gemini API for generating audio from text, applying various stylistic tones. It leverages websockets for real-time communication with the Gemini API and pygame for audio playback.

This project is inspired by the [Voice Cursor](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/gemini-demos/tree/main/voice-cursor) project, an experimental text editor showcasing Gemini 2.0's Native Audio capabilities. Our script aims to replicate the text-to-speech functionality but as a command-line tool.

## Current Functionalities

-   **Native Gemini Audio:** Direct integration with Gemini 2.0's text-to-speech capabilities via websockets.
-   **Multiple Voice Options:** Select from various pre-defined Gemini voices for the audio output.
-   **Rich Tone Selection:** Choose from a wide array of stylistic tones to apply to the text before generating audio.
-   **Flexible Input:** Input text directly or from a text file.
-   **Real-time Audio Playback:** Plays generated audio using pygame.

## Planned Enhancements

-   **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Development of a GUI to provide an easier and more interactive way to use the script.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.9 or higher
- `asyncio`
- `websockets`
- `wave`
- `pygame`
- `numpy`
- `IPython` (for displaying Markdown, optional)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install websockets pygame numpy ipython
Use code with caution.

Configuration
GOOGLE_API_KEY: You must set this environment variable with your Google Gemini API key. Get your API key from Google AI Studio.

MODEL: (Optional) Specifies the Gemini model to use. The default value is models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp.

Available Voices: The script uses a predefined set of voices: Puck, Charon, Kore, Fenrir, and Aoede. The default voice is set to Kore, but you can change this in the code.

Usage
Set the GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable. For example, in Linux or macOS, you can use:

export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Use code with caution.
Bash
Or, on Windows:

$env:GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
Use code with caution.
Powershell
Run the script:

python your_script_name.py
Use code with caution.
Bash
The script will prompt you to:

Select a tone by entering the corresponding number. You can also enter 0 to skip tone selection.

Choose an input mode: 1 for direct text input, 2 for text from a file, or exit to quit.

Provide the required text, either by typing directly or providing a filename.

The script will process the text, generate the audio with the selected tone, and play it back using pygame.

Stylistic Tones
The script includes a variety of stylistic tones, each influencing the way the text is spoken. Here's a list of supported tones:

Number	Emoji	Name	Description
1	üí¨	Neutral	The text is spoken without specific emotion or style.
2	üîÆ	Mysterious	The text is spoken like a dramatic wizard with a mysterious tone.
3	üòÉ	Excited	The text is spoken with high enthusiasm and energy.
4	üòÆ	Surprised	The text is spoken with genuine shock and amazement.
5	üòî	Sad	The text is spoken with a melancholic and dejected tone.
6	üò°	Angry	The text is spoken with intense anger and frustration.
7	‚ùì	Uncertain	The text is spoken as if asking a question, even if it isn't, and with confusion.
8	ü¶ó	Whispering	The text is whispered in a hushed, secretive voice.
9	üóØÔ∏è	Yelling	The text is shouted with maximum volume and urgency.
10	üê¢	Slow	The text is spoken very slowly and deliberately.
11	üê∞	Fast	The text is spoken rapidly and energetically.
12	üèÑ	Surfer	The text is spoken like a mellow surfer using surfer slang.
13	üé≠	Shakespeare	The text is spoken like a Shakespearean actor during a dramatic monologue.
14	üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è	Pirate	The text is spoken like a pirate, using pirate slang.
File Input
When selecting file input (2), the script will read the entire file content as a single block of text and apply the selected stylistic tone.

Error Handling
The script provides basic error handling for:

File operations (e.g., if a file is not found).

API connection errors.

Audio playback errors.

Code Structure
main(): Contains the main program loop, handling user input, API interaction, and audio output.

generate_audio(ws, text_input): Sends text to the Gemini API via websocket and processes the audio response.

audio_playback_task(file_name, stop_event): Plays audio using pygame until stopped.

wave_file(filename, channels, rate, sample_width): Context manager to handle wave file operations.

neutral(text), mysterious(text), etc.: Functions for applying stylistic tone transformations to text.

read_from_file(filename): Reads the content of a file.
